<p class="drop-cap neg-indent2">THE following play was produced at
Cambridge in December 1907 and January 1908. It was acted six times
altogether, to full houses, upon a temporary stage in the schoolroom
of St. Mary’s Convent, by the girls of the school, whose ages ran from
six to eighteen. The scenery, the properties, and the costumes were
constructed—with the exception of two simple Eastern dresses and a
few weapons—out of materials lent to the convent or possessed by it.
The cost, therefore, was extremely small; the trouble only was great,
and this lay almost entirely in the learning of the parts and the rehearsals.</p>

<p>It is alleged sometimes, as one reason for fearing such performances,
that the spirit of the age is very different from that in which this
method of bringing the Christian mysteries before the eye was almost
universally practised. This fear, of course, was not absent from the
minds of those responsible for this production, but it proved wholly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
illusory. The audience, consisting of Catholics and non-Catholics drawn
from all classes, was begged, by a sentence on the printed programme,
to refrain from all applause and conversation, and loyally responded to
the request. There was practically a dead silence from the first notes
of the first carol to the departure of the audience at the end.</p>

<p>It has been thought worth while, therefore, in this age of Pageants,
to print and publish the text of a play which has for its object the
furthering of devotion to the Nativity of our Blessed Lord, and which
has been put to the test of actual performance before a mixed assembly,
in the hope that others perhaps may venture upon a task which to its
original promoters has appeared at least to justify its inception.
Full directions are given in appendices as to the methods by which the
staging was accomplished and the properties constructed, as well as,
in the text itself, minute stage directions as to the movements of
the actors. Realism and passion have been studiously avoided in the
training of these; and in their place a kind of slow and deliberate
simplicity has been arrived at throughout. There was practically no
attempt made to disguise the faces of the actors, except in the matter
of a brown stain applied to the faces and hands of a few, and of two or
three beards in the cases of old men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p>In case, however, that the recommendations given in the book do not
seem sufficient to others, the author will be happy to answer any
questions that he can.</p>

<p>The present edition contains illustrations, appendices, and stage
directions; a cheaper acting edition shortly to be issued will contain
only the words with a few necessary remarks.</p>

<p>The collection from which the carols are taken is one compiled by Dr.
Stainer and the Rev. H. R. Bramley, under the title “Christmas Carols,
New and Old.” It is published with music by Novello. Acknowledgments
are made in the proper places.</p>

<p>An admirable orchestral effect may be produced by the use of a piano
and an American organ played together.</p>

<p>The play as a whole does not aspire to be considered a literary
production; it is only published as a practicable drama.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_t.jpg" width="60" height="61" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap neg-indent2">THE stage on which the play was acted
was about four feet in height, twenty-four in width, and twenty-four
in depth. It was furnished temporarily with footlights consisting
of gas-tubing pierced by seven burners shaded with tin head-lights
permanently fixed, two side-lights also permanent, and two incandescent
burners behind the back-scene.</p>

<p>As substitutes for all these except the last, oil lamps are suggested,
hung or standing and guarded with wire; for the last, a strong
acetylene light.</p>

<p>The scenery throughout consisted of these things only—a permanent back
scene, hung from a roller, constructed of opaque, dark, grey-blue paper
pierced irregularly with very small holes; six wings, three on a side;
two dark curtains hung on a wire to slide backwards or forwards across
the back-scene, about a dozen dust-sheets and a quantity of brown paper
and cotton-wool. (It must be remembered that the object was not to produce
startling stage effects, but rather a soothing and suggestive background.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>These extremely simple accessories were employed as follows:</p>

<p><i>First Scene.</i>—The curtains were drawn back out of sight altogether
behind the backmost wings. The floor was entirely and irregularly
covered with dust-sheets, and, to aid the appearance of irregularity,
various objects, such as footstools and blocks of wood were placed
beneath them. The wings were managed in this manner. Each of them was
a light framework of about three feet in width and ten in height.
One side of them (that presented to the audience in this scene) was
covered with large sheets of brown paper of all shades, deliberately
crumpled and bulging, and, here and there stained with paint. Upon the
upper side of each irregularity was gummed a flat thick piece of wide
wadding, following the curve of the paper, to represent fallen snow.
These six wings, placed of course not parallel with the back-scene but
slightly towards it, provided three exits on each side, two of which
only were used.</p>

<p>Finally, the back-scene, painted with whitewash at its bottom to
represent a distant line of snow-covered hills, hung full in view. All
lights except the incandescent burners behind were turned extremely
low; and the result of this elementary composition was a really
astonishing effect of a snowy defile between rocks, seen at night time,
with a sky blazing with stars. The light necessary for the seeing of
the actors’ faces was supplied by the lanterns they carried.</p>

<p><i>Second Scene.</i>—The curtains were drawn forward so as nearly to meet
in the centre, giving a glimpse only of the back-scene which throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the entire play remained in its place. The wings were reversed, showing
their other sides to the audience. These reverse sides were covered
with smooth yellowish paper, painted to represent large blocks of pale
stone. The wings, it must be said, had no attachment at the foot, but
the heads of them turned in iron forks, like the rowlocks of a boat,
reversed and fixed to beams above at the proper intervals. One of the
wings, that nearest the back-scene (R.), was painted to represent a
tall door with iron scrollwork across it. Lights up.</p>

<p><i>Third Scene.</i>—This was the same as the first, but the large
properties used in this prevented a sense of monotony. Lights down.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Scene.</i>—This was the same again, with other large properties.
Lights half down.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Scene.</i>—This was the same again with further properties. Lights
up.</p>

<p>Finally, overhead throughout were hung ordinary “flies,” or long strips
of cotton, as broad as the stage and about two feet deep.</p>

<div class="section"><h3>II. THE PROPERTIES</h3></div>

<p>Under this head it is proposed to describe chiefly those properties
that needed actual construction. For all the articles used throughout,
such as the table and stools in the kitchen-scene, it is enough to say
that they should be as simple and rough as possible. They should be
even rather dirty.</p>

<p>In the <i>first scene</i> there is no property used beyond those connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
with costumes (to be described later) except the tree-stump on
which the shepherd sits. This is simply a three-legged stool with a
dust-sheet draped over it.</p>

<p>In the <i>second scene</i>, there is the fire over which the inn-keeper is
cooking. A strong black bandbox was taken, and from it were cut out
sections, supported by uprights, making it to resemble a road-mender’s
brazier. On the floor of this stood a cylindrical candle-lantern with a
burning candle within; and round this lantern was wrapped red flannel.
Between the flannel and the bars of the “brazier” were inserted sticks
at irregular intervals. The whole thing was placed on a three-legged
stool, and a brown cooking-dish rested on the top.</p>

<p>In the <i>third scene</i> this fire figured again, standing on the ground.
Most of the stage R. was occupied by the shepherds’ shelter, with
room, however, left to pass both behind and before it. The shelter
was constructed of a three-sided clothes-horse, about six feet high;
and this was hung all over and roofed by pieces of old sacking and
deer-skins. The opening was towards the audience. A hurdle, standing on
end, projected above the roof.</p>

<p>The “lamb” was life-size, ingeniously made out of cotton-wool, with
a cotton skin on which were painted eyes and mouth. It is wrapped
throughout in a piece of sacking, so that no more of it need be
finished than the head and front legs.</p>

<p>In the <i>fourth scene</i> the chief property is the crib. A box was taken
about four feet long, by three by two, and set on one of its long
sides upon a table. The whole of the box and table was then covered
with crumpled and painted brown paper, resembling that fastened to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
wings; straw was laid inside, and a silver lamp hung from the edge to
the upper side. The starry sky at the back was variegated by a large
hurdle projecting from behind the crib. The bambino was supplied by a
well-known firm in London.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>fifth scene</i>, from which the crib is absent, the principal
property is the throne and dais. This needs little comment. The dais
came from a schoolroom; and the chair was a very tall armless one of
yellowish wood. Two tall mahogany candlesticks stood on either side
upon the dais. The book used by the boy was a large leather volume
bound by strings.</p>

<div class="section"><h3>III. THE COSTUMES</h3></div>

<p>Before treating these in detail, it is necessary to treat first the
general principles that were followed.</p>

<p>These were:</p>

<ul class="index">
<li class="isub1">1. That the drapery should be voluminous.</li>
<li class="isub1">2. That the colours should be dark and soft.</li>
<li class="isub1">3. That the dresses should be shaped after Eastern models.</li>
<li class="isub1">4. That all such things as tinsel and spangles should be utterly eschewed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the foundations of Eastern dress are the following:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The <i>Tunic</i>.—This is a long-sleeved garment resembling an alb. It
may be of any colour, or white. In the case of young men and boys it is
drawn through the girdle up to the knees.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Burnous</i> or Mantle.—This is more difficult to describe; but
it may be constructed by taking a large rectangular piece of stuff,
about four feet deep by six feet wide. Imagine this spread out on the
ground. Then take the top corners and fold them in about eighteen
inches along the top edge, folding in at the same time the whole length
of the stuff below. Sew along the top edge only to right and left, thus
making supports for the shoulders. Then cut at either side, near the
top, in the crease of the stuff, two wide arm-holes. Finally, fix about
eighteen inches down the front, on the folded stuff, a strong hook and
eye on either side.</p>

<p>The <i>Burnous</i>, then, is generally worn simply as a wide and voluminous
cloak, fastened by the hook and eye; but in the case of one or two the
arms may be put through the holes. It should be made of heavy stuff,
and should hang loosely and even clumsily. It may be variegated with
effect by long strips of stuff or some other colour attached down the
front of the folded wings and straight over the shoulders down the back.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Girdle</i>.—This may be of rope in the case of the poor, and of
rich stuffs in the case of the rich. When the girdle is wide weapons
may be thrust into it.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Head-dress</i>.—This is of two kinds:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent">(1) The turban proper, made of voluminous thin
material wound round the head and tucked into the top.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(2) A large thin piece of stuff, made to fit the
head by a ring of elastic on the inner side and flowing down behind
over the shoulders and back.</p>
</div>

<p>5. The <i>Foot-gear</i>.—This must consist of sandals, with the addition,
in the case of those whose skirts are worn to the knee, of voluminous
stuff wrapped round the leg and tied there by cris-cross bindings of
string or leather, or the material used by gardeners for tying up plants.</p>

<p>Now, if these principles are followed, the rest is easy. (The “Kings”
and the “Angels” need separate treatment.)</p>

<p>1. <i>Mary.</i>—She wears a night-dress to her feet. Over this she wears
a tunic of dark-blue muslin, also coming to her feet; a white burnous;
a long white veil; and sandals. In the fifth scene she is, after the
first fall of the curtain, robed in a white cope, and crowned. A
sceptre is also put into her hands.</p>

<p>The <i>crown</i> was an imperial one, constructed of cardboard covered
with crumpled gold paper, with strings of jewels and brooches, over a
crumpled cap of dark-blue velvet. The sceptre can be made in the same
kind of way.</p>

<p>2. <i>Joseph.</i>—He wears a white tunic to his feet, with heavy white or
yellowish girdle; a dark-red burnous striped with white; and a white
handkerchief over his head and shoulders. He is bearded and browed with
grey over a stained face. [See below.]</p>

<p>3. <i>Tobias.</i>—He wears a dark-blue tunic with broad brown girdle,
brown burnous and turban of “Rhodian” silk. He is girt to just below
the knee, and wears hose and sandals. His face is stained and eyebrows darkened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>David.</i>—He wears simply a short-sleeved dark-green tunic and cord
girdle; hose and sandals.</p>

<p>5. <i>Zachary.</i>—He wears a long yellowish tunic to his feet, a brown
burnous striped with white, a brown handkerchief on his head; and
sandals. He is bearded and browed with grey over a stained face. [See
below.]</p>

<p>6. <i>Ezra and Ben-Ezra.</i>—These are in short dark-brown tunics and are
wrapped in deer-skins. If skins are not available, burnouses must
be substituted. <i>Ezra</i> wears a red handkerchief on his head, and
<i>Ben-Ezra</i> a white turban. They carry spears.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Three Merchants.</i>—These are all in long tunic and burnous of
various darkish colours. All wear turbans and sandals, and Eliphaz a
fur wrap. The stuffs used should be of better quality than the others,
each of them wearing at least one piece of silk. Each has a broad
girdle, in which is a knife or two. They may carry or wear beads.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>—She wears a white tunic, falling half-way between knee and
foot, and dark-blue burnous; hose and sandals.</p>

<p><i>Abel.</i>—He wears a white tunic and deer-skin, with hose and sandals.</p>

<p><i>Herald.</i>—He is dressed simply in a long girded white tunic and
sandals.</p>

<p><i>The Angels.</i>—These, as a foundation, wear night-dresses, girded.
Over this each wears the dress of one of the three Greater Orders. The
“priest-angels” wear crossed stoles; the “deacon-angels” dalmatics, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the “subdeacon-angels” tunicles. These garments are all made of
voluminous white butter-muslin. They should wear no wings or spangles
or colours of any kind whatsoever. Their hair is combed out at length
over their shoulders. Two “priest-angels” carry drawn swords upright.</p>

<p><i>The Three Kings.</i>—These must be dressed as gorgeously as possible,
with any materials available; but the following points may be
remembered with advantage. The colours used should be splendid, but
not light or gaudy. (If, for example, light-blue is used, it is seen
at once to be entirely out of scale with the other figures—heliotrope
and purple and dark-red or green are far more effective.) Each should
present one predominant colour. Each should wear, in addition to tunic
and mantle, a long train pinned to the shoulders, edged with ermine.
(Ermine is produced effectively by long strips of cotton wadding dotted
with black stuff “tails.”) The crowns should be set inside or outside
of voluminous turbans of silk. The jewellery worn by them should be
heavy and effective and barbaric; for example, a twisted serpent of
gold paper turned up the arm, or a heavy collar across the shoulders.</p>

<p>The <i>Servant</i> of the Kings should be dressed on the same lines, but
without mantle or train.</p>

<p><i>Gaspar</i> should be bearded and browed with grey; all four persons
should be heavily stained on face and hands.</p>

<p>A suitable stain may be obtained from Mr. Peck, chemist, Trumpington
Street, Cambridge, such as is used in the “Greek Play” at the
University.</p>

<p>The beards used should not be the ordinary beards made in a piece. Hair
should be obtained from a theatrical property shop, and affixed piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
by piece with strong spiritgum. For those who wear beards a few lines
upon the face are generally necessary to blend the complexion with the
hair.</p>

<div class="section"><h3>IV. THE METHOD OF ACTING</h3></div>

<p>It must be remembered that the play does not attempt realism. It is
full of deliberate anachronisms. To act, then, in a realistic manner
would be to appeal to the eye in one key and to the dramatic perception
in another. It was found therefore necessary during the rehearsals
to insist again and again upon a certain conventionality in gestures
and tones of voices. The actors were encouraged to be slow, to speak
extremely clearly, and to make large deliberate gestures rather than
spontaneous movements—to beckon, for instance, with the arm rather
than the hand. (This method was, of course, that followed in the recent
performances of “Everyman.”) On these lines it was found that the play
occupied slightly over two hours.</p>

<p>Especially necessary was this system in the case of such characters
as those of the “Herald,” “Mary,” “Joseph,” and the “Three Kings.”
The “Herald,” standing outside the curtains, holds himself perfectly
upright for the most part. When he bows, he bows low with both hands
across the breast; when he signs himself with the cross, he slowly
“envelops” himself [as M. Huysmans says] in his movement. The appeal of
“Mary” also depends entirely (since she does not speak) upon extremely
slow, dignified movements. When she swoons she remains motionless, sunk
upon herself; when she moves, she does so with extreme deliberation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
she looks for a long time at the character to whom she directs herself,
before moving in his regard.</p>

<p>In the same manner, “Joseph” is lost always in a contemplation of
“Mary”; his eyes are fixed on her; he keeps the same attitude for long
together.</p>

<p>So, too, with the “Three Kings.” They carry themselves extremely
upright, they make sweeping gestures, they chant rather than speak,
they bow and genuflect slowly and profoundly. The “Children” only are
allowed to be spontaneous, without being abrupt.</p>

<p>The character of “Zachary” is the most difficult of performance.
He has to avoid prosiness on one side and passion on the other;
“deliberateness” must be his watch-word. I am afraid he is rather a
tiresome person; but he is as necessary as the Greek chorus, to whom he
corresponds. He appears less tiresome if he is represented by a very
tall actor who carries himself bent.</p>

<p>Those responsible, then, for rehearsals, must not be afraid of long
silences in which little happens. The play is intended as a series of
meditations rather than of dramatic situations and developments. Again
and again, if the grouping is arranged upon a wide and semi-heroic
scale, the actors will be found to fall into tableaux, which may
well be looked at in silence. During the longer of these involuntary
tableaux, however, music is sung or played.</p>
